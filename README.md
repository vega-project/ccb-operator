<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This cloud computing base operator that consists of many different components designed with a microservices architecture,  can be deployed in an Openshift cluster in order to run different kinds of calculations that require a total consumption of the resources of specific worker nodes.  

Currently, it is being used to calculate a model that gives us a synthetic spectrum of uniformly rotating stars that is a far better representation of the observed data than a synthetic spectrum of non-rotating stars.  This result will be compared to the data acquired by the [ESA Hipparcos](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Hipparcos_overview) and [ESA Gaia](http://sci.esa.int/gaia/) space missions, as well as those carried out by ground-based observatories.

A non-detailed design looks like:

<!-- COMPONENTS -->
## Components

The operator consists of different components, each responsible for trivial but specific tasks. 
* Dispatcher
* Worker
* Result-collector
* Janitor

#### Dispatcher
The dispatcher is responsible for creating the calculations and assign them to workers. A calculation can be created either from adding a value in the database (Redis is currently used) or by creating a new one from the dashboard.

#### Worker
This component is a deamonset that will choose a specific labeled node to run, with the purpose of executing the given commands. Currently each execution will run the atlas12 and synspec commands.

#### Result-collector
This component is responsible for gathering the results of each completed calculation and organize them in an NFS storage.

#### Janitor
Because of the big amount of calculations that can be created in the cluster, this component is responsible for deleting any of the calculations that passed the retention time.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
* Openshift 4.x cluster
* Network file server (NFS) 

### Installation
1. Clone the repo and go to the folder
```sh
git clone https://github.com/vega-project/ccb-operator.git
cd ccb-operator
```
2. Start the deployment using your nfs IP
```sh
make deploy NFS_SERVER_IP=0.0.0.0
```
